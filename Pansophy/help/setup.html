a user account with full administrator privileges for that database.  You can also set up the
system on a pre-existing Phronesis database.  Simply place the "pansophy" folder with
all of its contents on your PHP-enabled web server, then open its URL in any supported web

For "MySQL server address..." you will need to enter a network address if the PHP and MySQL servers
are on different machines or leave this field blank if they are on the same machine.  For the remaining
fields you will need to enter the name of the database, the administrator username for this particular
database, and the password for that username.  Once you have entered these, click "Submit."  If you
are installing the system on a pre-existing Phronesis database, you will at this point be told that
the database has already been set up, and the next time you return to the URL where the system resides,
you will be greeted with the login screen.  However, if you are setting up a fresh database, you will
be taken to Step 2.</td></tr></table><br /><hr /></td></tr>
