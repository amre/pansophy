<br /><br />
To initiate a search, choose your "Search Type," choose your "Search Field," and then the desired
search term(s).  For example, if you want to search for issues having to with a fire, you would
choose "Issues" for Search Type and "Header" for the Search Field.  Then you would enter the word "fire" as your search term.  This would display all issues with
a headline containing the word "fire."<br><br>

If you searched students or issues, when the results for your search appear they will show up with a drop-down menu and checkboxes
next to each result.  You can check the checkboxes and select an operation from the drop-down menu to do some functions that it

<div align="center"><br /><img src="./images/addIssueScreen.png" width="100%" border="1" /></div><br /><br />
The "Header" should be a short, one-line description of the issue using keywords that will be useful for
searches (see <a href="#usingthesearchmenu">Using the search menu</a>).  
The header will be used as a quick reference for other users of the system.
<br /><br />
The Category of an issue gives users a means to apply a grouping to the issue for better searching and consistency.
<br /><br />
The issue level button sets the issue to be sensitive in nature (only certain users can see it) or a normal issue (everyone can see it).
<br><br>
The initial contact information includes the Students Associated entry field.
You should include all students whom you wish to associate with the initial contact.  For more help
with this step, see <a href="#usingstudentsassociated">Using the "Students Associated" search-and-add tool</a>.
<br><br>
For Description you should write a detailed summary of the contact that took place and be sure to include all students you associated with this contact.
<br><br>
In the bottom left corner of the page, you will see the "Watch Assignment" dropdown menu is set to "Do not watch" 
by default.  This means that if anyone else makes any changes affecting this issue (e.g., changes its status, 
adds a new Contact, etc.), nobody will receive an alert. To change the assignment to make First Watch users (and up)
be set to watch the issue, simply select the "First Watch" option from the list. Selecting "Everyone" will make all users watch the issue and
selecting "Just me" will have only you watch the issue.
